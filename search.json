    "text": "Data completeness\n\nNumber of Ski Areas\nLaurent Vanat’s 2022 International Report on Snow & Mountain Tourism compiled primarily national level data to report on global ski area metrics [1]. Vanat identified 5,764 ski areas worldwide, when limiting to “equipped outdoor ski areas covered with snow”, which excludes “indoor facilities, mountaineering-only areas, and other types of facilities such as dry slopes.” The 1,945 ski areas with 5 or more lifts qualified as a ski resort, of which 52 were deemed as major based on a threshold of “1 million skier visits per winter season”. OpenSkiMap contains 5,115 downhill ski areas with one or more lifts (i.e. equipped) and 1,635 with 5 or more lifts. This equates to 89% and 84% of Vanat’s respective counts. \nStuart Winchester identified 505 active ski areas in the United States as of 2023 [17]. Winchester required ski areas to have one or more lifts, a snow surface, operated for at least 1 day in the last season, excluding areas operating solely for personal use. OpenSkiMap contains 510 operating downhill ski areas in the United States. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Ski roses by hemisphere\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) The eye of skiing: A 2-dimensional polar histogram showing skiable vert by orientation (angular coordinate) and absolute latitude (radial coordinate). Orientations for ski run segments in the southern hemisphere undergo a hemispherical flip, such that a due west bearing remains due west, while a due south bearing becomes due north. Hence, orientation axis labels use the terms poleward and equatorward. Each 2D histogram bin’s fill color represents enrichment of observed combined skiable vert over an equal distribution of orientation within an absolute latitude band. Several processing steps help highlight the trends in the data: latitude bands without at least XX in combined vert are removed; a uniform prior is applied to orientations; and extreme enrichment values are clipped. Ski runs closer to the equator demonstrate a greater northeast preference.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Skiable vert by latitude: The histogram shows the combined skiable vert across all ski run segments for each absolute latitude bin, split by hemisphere. Downhill skiing is remarkably concentrated in both the northern hemisphere and around 45 degrees north!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Latitude insights of ski runs and their association with orientation.\n\n\n\nDeduplication of effort: OpenStreetMap used by Strava, etc. Single place to curate the world’s ski areas\nWe extract all segments comprising ski runs\nOrientation versus aspect\nAspect applies to polygons and lines. Most polygon runs also have a line run Orientation only applies to lines In the absence of trees, aspect would be a better indicator of sun exposure. However, with shading of trees, orientation could be a better indicator of sun exposure Weighting by vertical drop along a segment, likely brings orientation closer to aspect under the assumption that steeper trails are more likely to descend along the fall line. Orientation was more readily available because it just requires the coordinates of the run (latitude, longitude, elevation), which OpenSkiMap includes, and does not require computation on adjacent terrain. Ski trails that traverse the fall line are often graded, would the resolution of aspect measurements be sufficient Orientation might be more relevant for skiers ???\nWeighting segments by vertical drop. Downhill skiing is the art of descent. On flat terrain, the is no terrain shading based on topography\nTopographic shadowing versus vegetative shadowing"

    "text": "Skiers and riders, you’ve all seen these trail maps—they’re essential for navigating the mountain, finding the fastest lift, or planning your next epic run.\n\n\n\n\nIn particular, this map, beautifully painted by the legendary James Niehues, is of the South Face of Big Sky, Montana.\n\n\n\n\nBut have you ever wondered how common south-facing slopes are? In other words, do most ski trails in this hemisphere favor southern exposure, or are they more often found on the north side of the mountain? \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe began our journey to answer this question by gathering data from OpenSkiMap, which refines OpenStreetMap  to create an amazing interactive visualization of the world and all its ski trails. \n\n\n\n\nThousands of OpenStreetMap contributors have worked for decades to annotate ski areas and their trails. In this New Hampshire/Vermont region, … \n\n\n\n\n… you can see the iconic Killington and its neighbor Pico. \n\n\n\n\nHere is a local favorite, Whaleback Mountain. \n\n\n\n\nAnalyzing this data, we could see how much north-facing each ski area is by looking at its “ski rose”. \n\n\n\n\nTake, for example, Dartmouth Skiway in Lyme, NH. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThese are the two signature sides of the Skiway, Holt’s Ledge and Winslow Ledge. \n\n\n\n\nOn powder days, from Winslow, you can ski across the road and glide right to the bottom of Holt’s Ledge Double. \n\n\n\n\nIf we:\n\ngather the coordinates for all trail segments,\nconnect the dots,\ntreat each of these segments as a vector, and\nscale the vectors by their vertical drops,\n\nwe can summarize them in a …\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n… ski rose! Similar to how wind roses chart wind speed and direction at a location, ski roses characterize the directions of all trail segments at a ski area. \n\n\n\n\nEach spoke of the circular chart represents a compass direction, with its length proportional to the total length and vertical drop of trail segments in that direction. Highlighted is the Northwest by West spoke… \n\n\n\n\n… to which these particular segments contribute. \n\n\n\n\nAnd here’s the North North East spoke. While these NNE segments may seem small, their verticals contribute to a significantly larger spoke in the rose compared to others. \n\n\n\n\nWe can do this for other ski areas too!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere are 48 more roses. What do you think? Do most of them look north-facing to you? \n\n\n\n\nOur analysis of the slopes of all ski areas across the globe revealed a clear poleward and slight eastward bias. In other words, the majority of slopes in the northern hemisphere oriented toward the north and east, while those in the southern hemisphere are oriented toward the south and east. \n\n\n\n\nThis trend likely reflects the desire to maximize snow retention and minimize sun exposure, ensuring better skiing conditions and longer seasons. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn addition to trail bearings, we have published data on other key metrics of a ski area like total verts, number of lifts, and  peak elevations for ski areas across the world.  In the table below, you can search for your favorite ski area and explore all of its summary statistics. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n    \n\n    \n    \n\n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWant the inside scoop?
